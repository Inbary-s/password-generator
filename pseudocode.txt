    //Project Plan:

    // FRONT END:
    Check off anything that's done:
    - create wireframe for password generator  // done 
    - Create JS file:
        - figure out logic as follows(?):
            //Pseudo Code//
            ///code description:
              - prompt("Please select the length of your password. A good password is at least 8 characters and at a maximum of 128 characters")  
                    - limit response to only numeral
                    - limit to 8-128 range
                    - create error alert for anything else
              - Alert #1 ("select at least one of the following options")
              - Alert #2 ("Would you like to include special characters?")
              - Alert #3 ("Would you like to include numeric characters?")
              - Alert #4 ("Would you like to include lowercase characters?")
              - Alert #5 ("Would you like to include uppercase characters?")
              - Validate at least one is confirmed
              - window.write (print) to the page the generated password.
              - Create a "Copy PW" button (**bonus / time permiting)

            ///Pseudo:
            if (prompt value i.e x >= 8 && x < 128) {
                alert #1;
                alert #2;
                alert #3;
                alert #4;
                alert #5;
            } else {
                alert error
            } 
            function(generator) = mathfloor.mathrandom
                if alert #2 = true - include special characters
                if alert #3 = true - include numeric characters
                if alert #4 = true - include lowercase characters
                if alert #2 = true - include uppercase characters
                print return on HTML
